<p>The <em>golden retrievers</em> is awesome because <strong>  are gentle, loving, and intelligent, they quickly warm up to other animals in the home. This includes cats and smaller pets. You won't have to worry about dreadful pet quarrels in your home with a golden retriever. Plus, golden retrievers are protective of their family.</strong>.</p>
